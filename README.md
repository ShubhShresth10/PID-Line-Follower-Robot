# PID-Line-Follower-Robot
PID Line Follower is a high-speed, fully autonomous line-following robot designed to track a path with maximum precision and stability. It uses an array of IR sensors to detect the line position and a PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) control algorithm to continuously correct its trajectory in real time.

The goal of this project is to build a bot that can handle sharp turns, curves, and varying track conditions while maintaining high speed and smooth motion. The PID controller minimizes oscillations and overshoot by calculating an error value from the sensor readings and adjusting the speed of each motor accordingly.
