# PID-Line-Follower-Robot
PID Line Follower is a high-speed, fully autonomous line-following robot designed to track a path with maximum precision and stability. It uses an array of IR sensors to detect the line position and a PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) control algorithm to continuously correct its trajectory in real time.
